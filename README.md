# Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship Tasks

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the three core tasks completed during my one-month Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The internship provided hands-on experience in various aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization using Python.

**Intern:** Sreelakshmi RV
**Internship Period:** Jan 2025
**Organization:** Oasis Infobyte

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Retail Sales Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)
* **Description:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into customer purchasing behavior, popular products, and sales performance.
* **Key Learnings:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, statistical summarization, and creating informative visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots, histograms) using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook.

### Task 2: E-commerce Data Analysis & Customer Segmentation
* **Description:** Analyzed an e-commerce dataset to understand customer demographics and purchasing habits. Applied clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers into distinct groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
* **Key Learnings:** Data preprocessing for segmentation, feature engineering, understanding and applying unsupervised learning algorithms, and visualizing clusters using libraries like Seaborn.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for clustering), Jupyter Notebook.

### Task 3: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
* **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. Implemented a linear regression algorithm and evaluated model performance.
* **Key Learnings:** Regression analysis, feature selection, model training and evaluation (e.g., R-squared, Mean Absolute Error), and using machine learning frameworks.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization), Jupyter Notebook.
